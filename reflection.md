Offline meeting:

The team was made on the Thursday tutorial of week 2 so we only have about 1 week
to do it. We had a 4-members face to face meeting, and 2 2-members face to face meetings

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       date       |        time         |     members     |       outcome
     1 oct        |     18.00-19.00     |     all         |  understand the project, distribute work
     3 oct        |     20.00-22.00     |   Justin, Mike  |  looked into some specific functions, completed 3
                                                             test funtions, found some questions and prepared
                                                             to ask on the lab tomorrow
     3 oct        |     15.00-17.00     |   Ben, James    |  discussed the user stories, discussed about how
                                                             to do the pytest

Online meeting:

We formed a group chat on Messenger and a Google Doc that specified the work
distribution.
Each member need to complete the pytest for 8 functions.
James and Ben did the majority part of user stories and assumptions
Justin and Mike did the majority part of reflection and plan


improvement:

Lack of face to face meeting time, need to have more in the future.
Procrastination. The first face to face meeting was a bit late so we need to meet up early for iteration2
We had a clear work distribution at the start but we found that the work actually needs to completed collaboratively. More meetings or discussions are required for the next iteration.
