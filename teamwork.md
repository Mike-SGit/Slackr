# Meetings:
The same meetings structure was employed in both Iteration 2 and Iteration 3.  
These in person meetings followed a similar structure:
  * A standup discussing current issues faced in the project.
  * During the standup, members also discuss what modules have been completed  
        or are being worked on.
  * Identifying priorities and how best to approach the next modules.
  * Peer programming was essential in viewing how other members understand  
        one's code and their interpretation of how some pieces of code interact.
      * i.e. the data structure of channels and messages and how they interacted. 
      * i.e. how data is passed throughout the program.

# How we had multiple people working on the same code:
  * We had code that was largely self-contained to each member. This ensured that each function was  
        able to be unit tested easily and did not greatly intefere with outside functions other members were writing.
  * If merge conflicts did arise, they were to be quickly settled by:  
    1. Discussing how the conflict came about
    2. What code is most necessary
    3. Resolving the merge conflict
    4. Updating any code that was dependant on the overwritten code.
  * More peer programming was applied in iteration 3
        face to face communication made the teamwork process more efficient and effective.
